# Turkey Stuffing
To go in a turkey or other bird's carcass. Yum. Don't forget to also put it in the neck if it's a turkey. The rest can go in the pan around the bird.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 lb of butter (yes, for real)
- A bunch of carrots
- 1 stalk celery
- 2 yellow onions
- bread (a crusty bread is quite nice. A baguette or boule, but can be done with regular bread)
- Optional: chicken stock

*Spices:*
- rosemary
- thyme
- sage
- oregano
- onion powder
- garlic powder
- pepper
- salt

## Steps
1. Cut the bread into 1 inch cubes, toast the pieces
2. Melt the butter in a pan
3. Add the vegetables and spices. It's sort of a vibes things for spices. Cook until soft. It should still have some liquid butter in it.
2. Add the toasted bread to a bowl and pour the butter over it. Mix until the bread is well coated. If you find it's still too dry (i.e. there are spots on the bread that aren't damp), add some chicken stock.
